Since this is for a SharePoint position this file needs to be unzipped and loaded into a SharePoint libary.  This was written against an on-premise SP 2016 farm.

Once unzipped you can load this into the Site Assets libary of your choosing all the support files are located in the Program folder.

NOTE;  The graphics calls wil NOT run in IE.  You will only see the backs of the cards.

Known bug:  After completing the first game, the winning dialog will no longer show the number of winning moves.

SECOND NOTE: For whatever reason a generic aspx page got included in the zip file instead of the one that I created on the site.  Included the aspx version that does contain the links into the folder separately.
